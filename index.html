            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is <strong>Sherri</strong>, and I have been on an incredible journey of personal growth and learning. I have a deep love for basketball, especially for the <em>Dallas Mavericks</em>. Watching games is not just a pastime for me; it’s a way to connect with the community and celebrate the spirit of sportsmanship.</p>
            <p>Recently, I faced a significant loss with the passing of my mother, who was not only my biggest supporter but also my best friend. She was the kind of person whose presence brought warmth and encouragement to everyone around her. For me, she was the steady source of strength I could always lean on. Her unwavering belief in my potential inspired me to aim higher, dream bigger, and believe in myself even when I doubted my abilities. Losing her has been a profound challenge, but it has also deepened my gratitude for all that she gave me.

              <p>One of the most enduring lessons my mother taught me was the value of education. She often reminded me that knowledge was a powerful tool that could open doors to opportunities and help me shape a better future. It wasn’t just her words, but the way she lived her life with determination and purpose, that showed me the importance of perseverance. Her sacrifices and encouragement made it possible for me to pursue my education, and every step of my academic journey feels like a tribute to her love and belief in me.
              
              <p>As I move forward, my mother’s memory continues to guide me. Her voice, filled with kindness and wisdom, often echoes in my mind, reminding me to keep going, even when things get tough. I find strength in remembering how proud she was of my achievements and how excited she would be for all the milestones still ahead. Although she is no longer physically here, I feel her presence in my heart, cheering me on and giving me the courage to chase my dreams.
              
              <p>This journey is about more than just reaching personal goals—it’s about honoring her legacy. Every accomplishment I achieve is not just for me but also for her, as a way to thank her for the sacrifices she made and the endless love she gave. Her influence has shaped who I am, and carrying her lessons forward feels like the best way to keep her spirit alive. I strive to embody her values of kindness, resilience, and determination in everything I do.
              
              <p>Even in the midst of this loss, I find comfort in knowing that my mother’s love and guidance will always be a part of me. She was my biggest champion, and her encouragement continues to inspire me to make her proud. This journey, though bittersweet, is a meaningful way to honor her memory and ensure that her impact on my life remains a source of strength and inspiration.</p>
