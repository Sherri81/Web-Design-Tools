            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is <strong>Sherri</strong>, and I have been on an incredible journey of personal growth and learning. I have a deep love for basketball, especially for the <em>Dallas Mavericks</em>. Watching games is not just a pastime for me; it’s a way to connect with the community and celebrate the spirit of sportsmanship.</p>
            <p>Recently, I faced a significant loss with the passing of my mother, who was not only my biggest supporter but also my best friend. Her encouragement pushed me to pursue my education and follow my dreams, which makes this journey all the more meaningful.</p>

            <p>As I prepare to graduate in the Spring, I am filled with excitement and anticipation. Completing my education has been a long-term goal, and I know my mother would have been incredibly proud of my accomplishments. Her belief in my potential continues to motivate me every day.</p>

            <h2>My Journey to Recovery</h2>
            <p>Another crucial aspect of my life is my journey of recovery. I am proud to say that I have been in long-term recovery from addiction since February 2018. This journey has taught me resilience, strength, and the importance of community support. I am grateful for the second chance at life that I have been given.</p>
            <p>Being sober has transformed my perspective, helping me focus on my goals and aspirations. I aim to inspire others who may be struggling, showing them that change is possible and that it’s never too late to start anew. My journey is not just about overcoming challenges; it’s about embracing new opportunities and living life to the fullest.</p>
