<h1>Hello Classmates!!!</h1>
<h2>All about Sherri...</h2>
<p>I am about to graduate next sememster finally. I honestly would drop out because my mom passed away 3 months ago and I am really overwhelmed, but she was so proud of me for being about to graduate that I really want to finish in her memory. I'm doing the best I can and I'm actually really proud of myself for not giving up trying to figure out github and all of this bc i have been trying to figure out how to create a damn repo and get it to push to github and have yet figured it out. Praying I get it this time. :/</p>
