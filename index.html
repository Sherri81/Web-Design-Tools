            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is <strong>Sherri</strong>, and I have been on an incredible journey of personal growth and learning. I have a deep love for basketball, especially for the <em>Dallas Mavericks</em>. Watching games is not just a pastime for me; itâ€™s a way to connect with the community and celebrate the spirit of sportsmanship.</p>
            <p>Recently, I faced a significant loss with the passing of my mother, who was not only my biggest supporter but also my best friend. Her encouragement pushed me to pursue my education and follow my dreams, which makes this journey all the more meaningful.</p>
