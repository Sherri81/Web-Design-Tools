            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Web Production
                    <p>
                        <p>Web production is a dynamic and engaging field that blends creativity, technical problem-solving, and continuous learning. It offers professionals a unique opportunity to express their creativity, particularly in design, layout, and user experience (UX). Designing intuitive, visually appealing websites and crafting seamless user experiences can be highly satisfying, as it combines aesthetics with functionality. Whether working on color schemes, typography, or the overall brand identity, web production allows individuals to shape a website’s visual identity and make it both attractive and user-friendly.
                        
                        <p>At its core, web production involves tackling unique challenges, which makes it particularly enjoyable for problem solvers. Whether debugging code, optimizing performance, or finding creative ways to meet user needs, web production encourages innovative thinking. Technical challenges often feel like solving puzzles, and each solution brings a sense of accomplishment. Moreover, the field is constantly evolving, meaning there's always room to iterate and improve. This ever-changing landscape keeps the work fresh and engaging, as new tools and technologies continually emerge.</p>

                <li>Dallas Mavericks
                    <p>The Dallas Mavericks, commonly referred to as the Mavs, are a professional basketball team based in Dallas, Texas. They compete in the Western Conference of the NBA and play their home games at the American Airlines Center. Founded in 1980, the Mavericks quickly became a competitive force in the league, highlighted by their golden era in the early 2000s under owner Mark Cuban. Cuban, who bought the team in 2000, is known for his innovative and hands-on management style, which helped transform the Mavericks into a championship-caliber team. Key to their success has been a focus on acquiring and developing elite talent, most notably Dirk Nowitzki, who played 21 seasons with the franchise and is widely regarded as one of the greatest power forwards in NBA history.

                        <p>The Mavericks achieved their pinnacle of success during the 2010–11 season, when they won their first NBA Championship by defeating the heavily favored Miami Heat in a dramatic six-game series. The victory cemented Nowitzki's legacy and established the Mavericks as a resilient and well-rounded team. In recent years, the team has sought to build around rising superstar Luka Dončić, whose exceptional playmaking and scoring ability have brought renewed excitement to the franchise. With a mix of young talent and veteran leadership, the Mavericks continue to aim for sustained success in the highly competitive NBA landscape.</p>

                <li>Honoring my Mom's memory
                    <p>Honoring my moms memory is a very personal task, she was such a kind and loving person. She was fun and smart and loved her family so much. My mom loved the Dallas Mavericks and really all sports. We had season tickets to the Mavs, I have kept them and continue to go even though its really hard sometimes. Honoring her by staying sober is really important to me.</p>
                    <p>Another way I have honored my mom is me and my brother put her ashes under a tree we buried to allow her to grow with the tree. The healing process has been really hard sometimes. I know she is with me but it can get really hard. I feel like the best way I can honor her is to carry the characteristics about her that made her so special into my life and try to exude them as much as I can because thats how she lived.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Traveling the World
                    <p>My desire to travel the world comes from a yearning to explore the unknown and expand my horizons. Each destination offers a unique window into different cultures, histories, and ways of life. Traveling allows me to experience diverse cuisines, languages, traditions, and landscapes firsthand, which will deepen my understanding of the world and my place in it. This sense of adventure satisfies human curiosity, offering both the thrill of discovery and the opportunity to learn from people whose perspectives differ from my own. It’s not just about seeing famous landmarks or capturing stunning photos; it’s about immersing myself in the richness of the world’s diversity.

                        <p>Beyond exploration, traveling also fosters personal growth. It challenges you to step out of your comfort zone, adapt to new environments, and embrace uncertainty. Whether it’s navigating unfamiliar streets, trying a new food, or making connections with strangers, these experiences build resilience, confidence, and empathy. Traveling can also be a way to reconnect with yourself, offering time to reflect and find inspiration. Each journey brings a sense of fulfillment and creates memories that can last a lifetime, making the world feel both vast and intimately connected at the same time.</p>
