            <h2>My Journey to Recovery</h2>
            <p>Another crucial aspect of my life is my journey of recovery. I am proud to say that I have been in long-term recovery from addiction since February 2018. This journey has taught me resilience, strength, and the importance of community support. I am grateful for the second chance at life that I have been given.</p>
            <p>Being sober has transformed my perspective, helping me focus on my goals and aspirations. I aim to inspire others who may be struggling, showing them that change is possible and that it’s never too late to start anew. My journey is not just about overcoming challenges; it’s about embracing new opportunities and living life to the fullest.</p>
